## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What else should go here? 
  - Node JS
  - MongoDB

### Installing

1. Fork repository to your own GitHub

2. Clone to your local machine

3. Install Node modules

    - From the command line of your local project directory, run `npm intall` or `npm i`
    - If you receive the error `node not found`, or any similar errors, you likely don't have Node.js installed.  Visit [Nodejs.org](nodejs.org) to download and install nodejs. Once installed, begin step 3 again.
    
4. Open the project in the IDE of your choice. 

5. Launch the development server

    - Run `npm run dev`. This will launch the node development server called `nodemon`.
    
8. Open a browser and browse to http://localhost:5000 

## Deployment

To be updated at a later date.
